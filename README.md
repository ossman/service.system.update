# Kodi System Update Plugin

This is a plugin for [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) that allows you to keep your
Linux system up to date without leaving Kodi. It is based on PackageKit
and should work on most distributions.

The plugin checks daily for new updates to the system. If any are found
then they are downloaded and prepared. An update is scheduled for the next
reboot and the plugin will also offer to reboot the system for you.
